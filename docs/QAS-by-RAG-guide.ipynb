That is saying everything else is crap and dangerous. In other words, string theory can&#39;t sell itself as physics by any telling of the story. String theory is the most failed theory in the history of physics. If you look at the number of papers, the amount of money, the number of people, the number of PhDs, number of conferences, achievements in physics proper per investment or size of effort, it is the most failed theory in the history of physics. And the way in which it survives is by hunting and destroying its enemies and making its enemies dependent on them. We all have a circuit in our brain that we&#39;re going to run to the string theorists to talk about the problem with string theory because of peer review. It&#39;s like when I want to report the police department for being corrupt, you should go to the police with that. Wait, you&#39;re not understanding. So that&#39;s the problem.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9377928180417803</td><td align=left>133.0</td><td align=left>And I saw a tweet saying that somebody had been to a string theory convention and had asked the question, what is string theory? And the best string theorists on the planet came up with the answer, we kind of don&#39;t know what string theory is.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9573860154673669</td><td align=left>120.0</td><td align=left>And he said, quote, I can tell you with absolute certainty string theory is not the theory of the real world. I can tell you that 100%. My strong feelings are exactly that. String theory is definitely not the theory of the real world. Is that taking it out of context? Is that him framing it somewhere else? Or does that encapsulate the fact that he thinks string theory is a dead end that doesn&#39;t describe the world?</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9909664988765275</td><td align=left>100.0</td><td align=left>This is the big question. We don&#39;t know whether that we&#39;re talking about the stagnation of theoretical physics or just nuclear physics.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9922121082582246</td><td align=left>135.0</td><td align=left>Yeah. Is this too far gone for string theory now, is it? The mask is beginning to slip to the point where even Ed Dutton is going to have to eat his words within the next decade.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0233996483306704</td><td align=left>115.0</td><td align=left>I think I&#39;m just trying to say it&#39;s the problem with string theory, not the equations, not the shininess, not the advertising campaign. The problem is, look at how they treat everyone else. Everyone who is not a string theorist, who is trying to do stuff that could end up as a deemed export or as restricted data is covered and splattered in shit.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.027231944845438</td><td align=left>129.0</td><td align=left>Who else would you want to have a chat with the guys on the string theory side of the world?</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.033582027704631</td><td align=left>131.0</td><td align=left>So I don&#39;t know much or anything really about the inner workings of string theory, but Sabine Hossenfeld has been on the show, Brian Greene&#39;s been on the show, Sean Carroll&#39;s been on the show.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0574237432559146</td><td align=left>102.0</td><td align=left>I&#39;ll do the decision tree. One possibility is that they&#39;re simply saying that they made nuclear physics very, very difficult to do, and that has to do with not very sexy physics, the physics of protons and neutrons and nuclei. So that branch exists. The other branch says, we used string theory to cock block actual progress in theoretical physics and derailed an entire field, at least in public.</td></tr></tbody></table>"

That is saying everything else is crap and dangerous. In other words, string theory can&#39;t sell itself as physics by any telling of the story. String theory is the most failed theory in the history of physics. If you look at the number of papers, the amount of money, the number of people, the number of PhDs, number of conferences, achievements in physics proper per investment or size of effort, it is the most failed theory in the history of physics. And the way in which it survives is by hunting and destroying its enemies and making its enemies dependent on them. We all have a circuit in our brain that we&#39;re going to run to the string theorists to talk about the problem with string theory because of peer review. It&#39;s like when I want to report the police department for being corrupt, you should go to the police with that. Wait, you&#39;re not understanding. So that&#39;s the problem.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9377962967576634</td><td align=left>133.0</td><td align=left>And I saw a tweet saying that somebody had been to a string theory convention and had asked the question, what is string theory? And the best string theorists on the planet came up with the answer, we kind of don&#39;t know what string theory is.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9573803222849635</td><td align=left>120.0</td><td align=left>And he said, quote, I can tell you with absolute certainty string theory is not the theory of the real world. I can tell you that 100%. My strong feelings are exactly that. String theory is definitely not the theory of the real world. Is that taking it out of context? Is that him framing it somewhere else? Or does that encapsulate the fact that he thinks string theory is a dead end that doesn&#39;t describe the world?</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.9910115736190397</td><td align=left>100.0</td><td align=left>This is the big question. We don&#39;t know whether that we&#39;re talking about the stagnation of theoretical physics or just nuclear physics.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>0.992206146436619</td><td align=left>135.0</td><td align=left>Yeah. Is this too far gone for string theory now, is it? The mask is beginning to slip to the point where even Ed Dutton is going to have to eat his words within the next decade.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0233900207921507</td><td align=left>115.0</td><td align=left>I think I&#39;m just trying to say it&#39;s the problem with string theory, not the equations, not the shininess, not the advertising campaign. The problem is, look at how they treat everyone else. Everyone who is not a string theorist, who is trying to do stuff that could end up as a deemed export or as restricted data is covered and splattered in shit.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0272712184226906</td><td align=left>129.0</td><td align=left>Who else would you want to have a chat with the guys on the string theory side of the world?</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0336534449821548</td><td align=left>131.0</td><td align=left>So I don&#39;t know much or anything really about the inner workings of string theory, but Sabine Hossenfeld has been on the show, Brian Greene&#39;s been on the show, Sean Carroll&#39;s been on the show.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.057460017810909</td><td align=left>102.0</td><td align=left>I&#39;ll do the decision tree. One possibility is that they&#39;re simply saying that they made nuclear physics very, very difficult to do, and that has to do with not very sexy physics, the physics of protons and neutrons and nuclei. So that branch exists. The other branch says, we used string theory to cock block actual progress in theoretical physics and derailed an entire field, at least in public.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0621091872767383</td><td align=left>118.0</td><td align=left>He&#39;s very, very smart, and he&#39;s one of the most important string theorists ever, and he writes exceptionally clear and correct introductory books. Okay, but he is not a leading physicist.</td></tr><tr><td align=left>1.0630691390951843</td><td align=left>160.0</td><td align=left>So Kurt says, well, what do you think of Lee Smolin, Stephen Wolf from Eric Weinstein and Peter Woight? And Sean Carroll very deftly says, oh, I wouldn&#39;t put Lee Smolin in with them. The others are amateurs. Lee Smolin is a serious physicist. Peter White just wrote one of the greatest books in physics and mathematics I&#39;ve ever seen. A comprehensive guide to the role of group theory within the quantum symmetry within the quantum. Nobody knew that this guy had this in him. He was running this blog, and it was an excellent blog. Everybody in the community reads it, and many people pretend that they don&#39;t because it&#39;s very critical of string theory. But he&#39;s very, very good. Then he writes a book like this. Nobody saw it coming. Then he comes up with two theories, both of which I think are wrong, but are really, really clever, about the nature of the strong force, what would be called weaker hypercharge, and what would be called weak isospin and the origin of the left right asymmetry of the universe called chirality. And when I ask these critics, they have no idea what these theories are. It took me, like, 15 to 45 minutes to get the basic idea of both.</td></tr></tbody></table>"

       "The state of string theory, once a shining beacon of hope in the realm of theoretical physics, has become a subject of intense debate and controversy. At the forefront of this discussion are prominent figures like Sabine Hossenfelder, Brian Greene, and Sean Carroll, who have all weighed in on the matter, each bringing their unique perspectives and criticisms.\n",
       "\n",
       "String theory, which once promised to be the \"theory of everything,\" has struggled to deliver on its grandiose claims. Despite the vast number of papers, conferences, and PhDs dedicated to it, the theory has yet to produce concrete, verifiable predictions that align with the physical world. Critics argue that it has become the most failed theory in the history of physics, given the immense resources invested in it compared to its tangible achievements.\n",
       "\n",
       "The theory's survival seems to hinge on a combination of academic politics and a reluctance to abandon a once-promising idea. String theorists have been accused of stifling alternative approaches and maintaining their dominance through peer review and academic gatekeeping. This has led to a situation where even asking fundamental questions about the validity of string theory can be seen as a career risk.\n",
       "\n",
       "A telling anecdote from a recent string theory convention highlights the theory's current predicament. When asked, \"What is string theory?\" the best minds in the field could only muster a vague, uncertain response: \"We kind of don't know what string theory is.\" This admission underscores the theory's ambiguous status and the growing frustration among physicists who feel that string theory has diverted attention from more promising avenues of research.\n",
       "\n",
       "Prominent critics like Peter Woit and Lee Smolin have been vocal about the shortcomings of string theory. Woit, in particular, has gained recognition for his comprehensive critiques and alternative theories, which, while controversial, have sparked important discussions about the direction of theoretical physics.\n",
       "\n",
       "On the other hand, defenders of string theory, such as Leonard Susskind, argue that the mathematical elegance and potential insights offered by the theory should not be dismissed outright. However, even Susskind's staunchest supporters acknowledge that the theory has not yet fulfilled its promise and that its proponents must answer for the decades of unfulfilled expectations.\n",
       "\n",
       "The debate over string theory also reflects broader issues within the scientific community. The focus on high-profile, speculative theories has sometimes overshadowed more pragmatic, experimentally verifiable research. This has led to calls for a reevaluation of funding priorities and a renewed emphasis on empirical science.\n",
       "\n",
       "In conclusion, the state of string theory is one of uncertainty and introspection. While it remains a topic of significant interest and debate, its future is unclear. Theoretical physics may need to pivot towards new ideas and approaches, leaving behind the allure of string theory in favor of more grounded, experimentally verifiable pursuits. The coming years will likely see a continued reevaluation of string theory's place in the scientific landscape, as physicists seek to balance the allure of elegant mathematics with the demands of empirical validation."
